The first step is to import all the frameworks necessary for the program to run
    Import the os framework
    Import the sys framework

Next, we need to define the function to determine if the inputted file is valid.
    Define the function (validFile):
        Set the variable movieFile to the message that is outputted to the user.
        Create a while not loop which makes sure the file exists.
            Repeat the statement about the movie's file name.
        Return the movieFile variable

Define a function that opens the file and calculates the profit for each movie.
    Define the function (profit): with a parameter of openFile.
        In order to make sure the file exists create a try and except function.
            We need to set maxProfit to 0.
            Set maxProfitMovie to "".
            Start reading the code in the file.
            Create the 4 variables and make sure the line is split.
            Converting the budget variable to a float as well as the box office variable.
            Create a equation that sets the variable revenue equal to the variable boxOffice - budget variable.
            Next, create a if statement that sets revenue greater than maxProfit.
            Make sure maxProfit is equal to revenue.
            Make sure MaxProfitMovie is equal to movieTitle
            The except portion for the FileNotFoundError:
                Output to the user that the file does not exist.

Next, we need to output the movie with the highest profit to the user.
Then we need to return that variable.

Next, we need to create a function that outputs certain data to the file.
The parameters include the file to read and write.
    Set the variable newOutputFile equal to opening the file to read.
    Next, the program will start reading the code by each line.
    Create the 4 variables and make sure the line is split.
    Converting the budget variable to a float as well as the box office variable.
    Create a equation that sets the variable revenue equal to the variable boxOffice - budget variable.
    Output the variable newOutputFile, as well as the release date, the movie title and the revenue which is rounded to two decimal places.
    Making white spaces between each line in the output file.
    The except portion for the FileNotFoundError:
                Output to the user that the file does not exist.
                Making sure we exit the file.
    Return the function.

Create the main function.
    Output the purpose of the program to the user which is "The purpose of this program is to output the movie with the highest profit from a list you input."
    Call the valid input file function.
    Call the output file function.
    Call the profit function.
    Call the output function.
    Use Return
Call the main function.
